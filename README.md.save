Certainly! Here's a step-by-step summary of the code  for 
both the linear and nonlinear datasets, where we aim to achieve an 
accuracy of 0.95 for both cases:

**Linear Dataset:**

1. Generate a synthetic linear dataset with two features using 
scikit-learn's `datasets.make_classification` function.

2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data 
used for training and 20% for testing.

3. Create a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel 
using scikit-learn's `SVC` class.

4. Fit the SVM classifier to the training data.

5. Make predictions on the test data using the trained SVM classifier.

6. Calculate the accuracy of the linear SVM model by comparing the 
predicted labels to the true labels from the test data.

7. Visualize the decision boundary of the linear SVM model using a contour 
plot.

**Nonlinear Dataset (Circles):**

1. Generate a synthetic nonlinear dataset with two features using 
scikit-learn's `datasets.make_circles` function. This dataset contains two 
classes that cannot be separated by a straight line.

2. Split the nonlinear dataset into training and testing sets, with 80% 
for training and 20% for testing.

3. Create a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a radial basis 
function (RBF) kernel, which is suitable for handling nonlinear data.

4. Fit the SVM classifier to the training data.

5. Make predictions on the test data using the trained nonlinear SVM 
classifier.

6. Calculate the accuracy of the nonlinear SVM model by comparing the 
predicted labels to the true labels from the test data.

7. Visualize the decision boundary of the nonlinear SVM model using a 
contour plot.

The goal is to achieve an accuracy of 0.95 for both the linear and 
nonlinear datasets. The accuracy of each model is displayed in the titles 
of the corresponding plots, and the decision boundaries are plotted to 
visually understand how the SVM models classify the data.

Remember that the accuracy can vary based on the dataset and its 
characteristics, so it might not always be possible to achieve exactly 
0.95 accuracy. The code is designed to showcase how to train and evaluate 
SVM models on different datasets and visualize their decision boundaries.
